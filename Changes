0.07 Added BAG functionality to the Aut Framework. Through 
     Aut, configuration items can be set for a ticket.

0.06 Fixed a flaw in the ticket_all_admin_get() routine.
     This routine must check the validity of the given
     password for the RSA Private key, otherwise the underlying
     routine will give an error message for each account in the
     database.

0.05 The first meaningfull functional Aut Framework.

0.02 Small bugfix.
